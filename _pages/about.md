I am a [Lecturer in Quantitative Social Research](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/our-staff/profile/9336193/dennis-chao-yo-cheng){:target="_blank"} at [Birkbeck, University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. I am also the Director of Birkbeck's [Postgraduate Social Research Programmes](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/schools/social-sciences-history-philosophy/postgraduate-social-research-programmes){:target="_blank"} (PSRPs). I am broadly interested in the political economy of local governance and central-local relations in developing nations. Combining different computational, quantitative, and qualitative methods, my research in particular seeks to interrogate the institutional and policy foundations of nation-state building and socioeconomic development in multi-ethnic societies.

I received my PhD in [Political Science](https://polisci.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} from the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu){:target="_blank"} (UCLA), where I was a [Fulbright Scholar](https://www.fulbright.org.tw/){:target="_blank"}. Before coming to Birkbeck, I held fellowship positions at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} (Beijing) and the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (LSE). I am also a member of the steering group of the [Birkbeck Institute for Social Research](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/research/centres/birkbeck-institute-for-social-research){:target="_blank"} and the [Bloomsbury Quants Forum](https://www.ahlstromvij.com/quants){:target="_blank"}.
