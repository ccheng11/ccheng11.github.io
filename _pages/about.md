I received my PhD in political science from the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu){:target="_blank"} (UCLA). I apply computational, quantitative and qualitative methods to address a wide range of topics in the political economy of development and institutions. Through both comparative and historical lenses, I seek to unpack the institutional and policy foundations of nation-state building and socioeconomic development in multi-ethnic societies.

In January 2022, I will join [Birkbeck, University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Quantitative Social Research. Before coming to Birkbeck, I held fellowship positions at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} (Beijing) and the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (LSE). Between 2012 and 2014, I was a [Fulbright Scholar](https://www.fulbright.org.tw/){:target="_blank"} at UCLA. I received my MA in political science from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} and a dual BA in political science and journalism from [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"} (Taipei). I have also studied mass communication, politics, and sociology at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html){:target="_blank"} and the [National University of Ireland, Galway](https://www.nuigalway.ie/){:target="_blank"}.

I am an Affiliate Researcher/Research Associate in the [Department of International Development](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-development){:target="_blank"} and the [Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/){:target="_blank"} at LSE. I am also an Associate Editor for the WeChat Official Account "Empirical Legal Studies in China." In 2021, I am named an Asia Fellow by the [American Political Science Association](https://connect.apsanet.org/asia/home-page/){:target="_blank"}.
