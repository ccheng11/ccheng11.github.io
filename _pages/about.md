I received my PhD in political science from the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu){:target="_blank"} (UCLA). I apply computational, quantitative and qualitative methods to address a range of topics in the political economy of institutions and development. I seek to unpack the institutional and policy foundations of nation-state building and socioeconomic development in multi-ethnic societies through the lens of local government agencies â€” in particular, how they behave and interact with citizens and the central state.

In January 2022, I will join Birkbeck, University of London, as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Quantitative Social Research. Between 2019 and 2021, I held fellowship positions at Tsinghua University (Beijing) and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). Between 2012 and 2014, I was a Fulbright Fellow at UCLA. I received my MA in political science from Columbia University and a dual BA in political science and journalism from National Chengchi University (Taipei). I have also studied mass communication, politics, and sociology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the National University of Ireland, Galway.
