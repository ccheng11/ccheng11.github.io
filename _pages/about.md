I am a [Lecturer in Quantitative Political and Social Research](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/our-staff/profile/9336193/dennis-chao-yo-cheng){:target="_blank"} at [Birkbeck, University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. I am also the Director of Birkbeck's interdisciplinary [Postgraduate Social Research Programmes](https://search.bbk.ac.uk/search/courses/?q=&subjects=Social+research){:target="_blank"}, a Research Associate of the [Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research](https://www.icpr.org.uk/) and the Co-Director of the [Centre for Political Economy and Institutional Studies](http://www7.bbk.ac.uk/cpeis/){:target="_blank"}.

I am broadly interested in the political economy of governance and development. Combining different computational, quantitative, and qualitative methods, my research interrogates the institutional and policy foundations of nation-state building and socioeconomic development in multi-ethnic societies. Before coming to Birkbeck, I held fellowship positions at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} (Beijing) and the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} (LSE).
