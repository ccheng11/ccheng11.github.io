In this book project, *Autonomy in Autocracy: Local Decentralization and Nation-State Building in China*, I develop and test a new theory to explain how the designation of ethnic autonomous territories (EATs) has shaped the governance of subordinate non-Han ethnic groups and sustained the Chinese Communist Party's rule in post-1949 China. I argue that ethnic local autonomy allows the central leader to establish command over subnational political forces while countering inner-circle rivals.

Through statistical analysis, elite interviews, and comparative case studies, I demonstrate that ethnic local autonomy was not introduced simply to defuse potential ethnic secessionism. Instead, ethnic autonomous prefectures and counties have allowed the Chinese central leader to constrain the discretion of potentially defiant provincial elites, which in turn addresses the dilemma of delegation, when they faced strong competitors within the Politburo. 

  - I theorise ethnic local autonomy as an institution of agent control and explore how the presence of EATs can contribute to nation-state building. I have also identified similar historical cases of state-building via local decentralization reforms in Anciet and Republican China.

  - Drawing on an original dataset of Chinese political elites, I employ social network analysis and **supervised machine learning** to construct innovative quantitative indices of elite connectedness and the structural features of elite networks to examine the interplay of informal political ties and formal institutional changes.

This book project has received a grant of Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council as part of the highly competitive 2022 [Taiwanese Overseas Pioneers (TOP)](https://www.stpi.narl.org.tw/public/top.htm) scheme. In 2020, UCLA nominated my dissertation for APSA's William Anderson Award for the best doctoral dissertation in the field of federalism or intergovernmental relations, state, and local politics. In 2021, I was shortlisted for the Best Social Sciences Dissertation of the [International Convention of Asia Scholars (ICAS) Book Prize](https://www.iias.asia/the-newsletter/article/ibp-2021-english-language-edition-social-sciences).
