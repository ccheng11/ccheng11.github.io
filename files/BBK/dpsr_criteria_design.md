# Assessment Criteria: Research Design

Your research design will be evaluated against the following criteria.

 - **Description and clarity of research question and strategy**: the extent to which the research design identifies a robust and researchable question and sets out a plausible path to answering it in a reliable and convincing manner.

 - **Conceptual clarity (explanation of research and variables)**: the extent to which the work has understood key methods and ideas, defined ambiguous terms, and employed them correctly.

 - **Discussion and explanation of methods and methodology**: the extent to which the work provides a critical analysis of the method or methods, supported with evidence or cases that evaluates competing approaches and interpretations of their strengths and weaknesses rather than a purely descriptive or narrative discussion.

 - **Discussion of potential difficulties (practical, ethical)**: the extent to which the work shows an awareness of practical and ethical difficulties associated with particular research designs or specific research questions.

 - **Style and presentation**: the extent to which the work makes effective and correct use of the English language and is written in a clear and scholarly style with a use of the technical language of methods.

 - **Grade descriptors**: encapsulate a level of achievement in relation to bands of marks. For individual assignments they indicate how well the assessment criteria have been met.

And the marks will reflect:

 - 0-29: Totally inadequate work, which does not address a clear research question and shows little or no knowledge of methods.

 - 30-39: Inadequate work, which sets out a relevant research question, but does not show much evidence of reading, planning or an ability to develop a clear plan or critique it.

 - 40-49: Poor work, which shows some knowledge of methods and research design, but lacks organization.

 - 50-59: Satisfactory work, which shows an awareness of the major issues around research design and planning, shows knowledge of key terms and critiques of particular approaches. Does not show a clear understanding of rigorous, coherent planning.

 - 60-69: Good work, which offers a clear and coherent design and approaches the methods in a critical and balanced way drawing on examples and cases, and shows an awareness of critiques and limitations.

 - 70-79: Excellent work, which displays exceptional knowledge of research design, methods, literature and critiques/or a substantial measure of originality in approach.

 - 80-100: Outstanding research design in virtually all areas. Contains substantial evidence of original and independent thought, knowledge of critiques and innovation.
