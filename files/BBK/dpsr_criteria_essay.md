# Assessment Criteria: Essay 

The marking of your essay is based on the intended learning outcomes for the work being assessed, the knowledge, understanding and skills markers expect a student to display in the assessment task and which are taken into account in marking the work. 

Essays, exams and take-home tests are marked according to the following schema (not in order of importance): 

 - **Answering the question**: the extent to which the work has dealt directly and clearly with the assigned task and provided a focused answer to the particular intellectual problem posed. 

 - **Structure**: the extent to which the work demonstrates coherent organization of the material and an overall argument that proceeds logically from introduction to conclusion. 

 - **Conceptual clarity**: the extent to which the work has understood key terms and concepts, defined ambiguous terms, and employed them correctly. 

 - **Analytic Content**: the extent to which the work provides a critical analysis of the problem that evaluates competing arguments and interpretations rather than a purely descriptive or narrative discussion. 

 - **Literature**: the extent to which the work demonstrates familiarity with, and command of, the relevant scholarly writings on the subject to which the work is addressed. 

 - **Evidence and Examples**: the extent to which the work deploys apposite examples and pieces of evidence to support its claims, thereby turning unsupported assertions into critical arguments. 

 - **Style and Presentation**: the extent to which the work makes effective and correct use of the English language and is written in a clear and scholarly style. 

Grade descriptors: encapsulate a level of achievement in relation to bands of marks. For individual assignments they indicate how well the assessment criteria have been met. 

 - 0-29: Totally inadequate work, which does not address the question and shows little or no knowledge of the subject, and fails to deal with any of the issues.

 - 30-39: Inadequate work, which says something relevant to the question, but does not show much evidence of reading or an ability to develop a clear argument.

 - 40-49: Poor work, which shows some knowledge of the literature and addresses the question, but lacks organisation.

 - 50-59: Satisfactory work, which shows an awareness of the major issues, shows knowledge of the sources and of alternative approaches to the subject. Does not show a clear understanding of alternative arguments and makes uncritical use of sources.

 - 60-69: Good work, which treats the issues in a critical and balanced way, and shows an awareness of context, sources and different explanations.

 - 70-79: Excellent work, which displays exceptional knowledge of the literature and/or a substantial measure of originality.

 - 80-100: Outstanding work in virtually all areas. Contains substantial evidence of original and independent thought.
